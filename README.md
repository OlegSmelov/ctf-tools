| [wstrings](wstrings) | A wrapper for `strings` that finds wide strings (both little and big-endian, 16 and 32 bit) in addition to regular strings. |

**macOS note:** Tools are written with Linux in mind, and thus require GNU utils to run. Install `coreutils` and `binutils` with Homebrew, and make them the default for your current shell. BSD tools often lack features.
